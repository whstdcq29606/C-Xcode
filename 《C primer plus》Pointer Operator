#include <stdio.h>
// Operation to Array by pointer
int main(void){
    int a[2]={100,200};
    int b[2]={300,400};
    //What i Should do is testing the "*p++","(*p)++","*(p++)" and"*++p","*(++p)".
    int *p1,*p2,*p3;
    p1=p2=a;p3=b;
    printf("p1      p2      p3\n");
    printf("%d      %d      %d\n",*p1,*p2,*p3);
    printf("%d      %d      %d\n",*p1++,(*p2)++,*(p3++));
    printf("%d      %d      %d\n",*p1,*p2,*p3);
    return 0;
}
 //Then we will get this result:
 p1      p2      p3
100      100      300
100      100      300
200      101      400

"*p1++" means that first thing the complier to do is printing the value of p1, then p1 will add an address that point to a[1]:100;
"++*p1" first thing: update the p1 and p1 point to a[1], then print it's value a[1]=200;
"(*p)++" and "*(p++) has the same role as "*p1++";
"*(++p)" has the same role sa "++*p";
Please have a concerned view to "*(p++), it isn't add p1's pointed address firstly but printf the value b[0], then add address which is
represent b[1];
